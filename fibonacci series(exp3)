AIM: To generate a program to find the Fibonacci Series.
Algorithm:
1.Start the program.
2.Input the number of values we want to generate the Fabonacci series.
3.Initialize the count=0, n-1=0 & n-2=1.
4.If the n-terms <=0
5.Print “error” as it is not a valid number for series.
6.If n terms=1, it will print n-1 values.
7.While count <n-terms.
8.Print(n-1).
9.nth=n-1+n-2
10.We will update the variable, n-1, n-2, n-3=nth and soon, up to the required term.
11.Stop the Program.
Program:
nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

n1, n2 = 0, 1
count = 0 # check if the number of terms is valid
if nterms <= 0:
 print("Please enter a positive integer") # if there is only one term, return n1
elif nterms == 1:
 print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
 print(n1)

else:
 print("Fibonacci sequence:")
 while count < nterms:
 print(n1)
 nth = n1 + n2
 
 n1 = n2
 n2 = nth
 count += 1
Output:
How many terms? 5
Fibonacci sequence:
0
1
1
2
3
Result:To generate a program to find the fibonacci series is implemented successfully.
